### Q4: According to the Law of Large Numbers:
- A. As the sample size increases, the sample mean approaches the population mean
- B. As the sample size increases, the probability of an event approaches 1
- C. As the sample size increases, the variance of the sample approaches 0

### Q6: What does the Central Limit Theorem state?
- A. The sum of independent random variables always follows a normal distribution
- B. The sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases
- C. The mean of a large number of independent random variables is always equal to the population mean
- D. The variance of a sample is always less than the variance of the population

### Q9: What is the relationship between covariance and correlation?
- A. Correlation is the standardized form of covariance, bounded between -1 and 1
- B. Covariance is the standardized form of correlation, bounded between -1 and 1
- C. Correlation and covariance are different names for the same measure
- D. Correlation measures linear relationships while covariance measures non-linear relationships

### Q10: What does a p-value of 0.05 in a statistical test indicate?
