## Lesson Objectives

By the end of the lesson, you will be able to

* **Calculate and interpret fundamental probability metrics**, including expected value and measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode), to quantify uncertainty and analyze the behavior of random variables under the Law of Large Numbers.
* **Visualize common continuous and discrete probability distributions** (including Uniform, Gaussian, and Binomial) to effectively model underlying patterns in real-world datasets.
* **Apply statistical inference techniques**, such as z-scores, t-tests, and confidence intervals, to normalize data, compare sample means, and determine the statistical significance of observations.
